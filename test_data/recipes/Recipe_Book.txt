Pasta Carbonara

Ingredients:
1 pound spaghetti
4 large eggs
8 ounces pancetta or slab bacon, cubed
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
4 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
Instructions:
Cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water, following package instructions until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until it starts to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for another minute.
Beat eggs and Parmesan together in a bowl. Quickly whisk in some hot pasta water to temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling.
Add the drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly to coat the strands and create a creamy sauce.
Season with black pepper and serve immediately, garnished with additional grated Parmesan.
